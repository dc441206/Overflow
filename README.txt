---------------
 Polite Notice
---------------

This project is released under the MIT licence (free as in "free").

That said. This IS a community project, so issues, feedback, pull requests, etc.
are welcomed and encouraged.

-------
 Setup
-------

Before you start, you MAY need to run: `make setup`
to ensure you have an appropriate selection of hacker tools installed
...You only ever need to do this once

---------------
 The Challenge
---------------

1. Run the program with : `make run`

2. Select a game mode: {Easy, Medium, Hard}
   ...this only effects later challenges

2. Type in the (nick)name of a friend

3. Repeat until you have summoned all the friends you need to make a:
   complete, well groomed cerberean dog, wearing a Sherrif badge;
   with a deputy who is also wearing their Shiny Badge :)

BUT: To count as a win. You MUST be able to call each friend using:
	# the unmodified original code,
	# as executed by the unmodified original Makefile [qv. Instruction #1].

-------
 Notes
-------

The friends are presented in order of perceived difficulty,
but you may collect them in any order you wish.

You may use any tools you desire to work out how to solve the puzzles.
And feel free two write scripts in any language of your choosing
to help you speed run it.

If you want a benchmark: My helper scripts are written in BASh 
and I can speed run all 11 challenges in ~46 seconds.
...There is a LOT of room for improvement!

Tested on:-
	# Debian 12 x64 VM running inside VMWare v17
